A vast majority of the code came from the Kinde starter kit and the React docs. The docs can be found here: https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/react-sdk/

This is a demo app for a frontend app written using React and authenticated using Kinde authentication. The backend code can be found here: https://github.com/abbievance/kinde-auth-demo-backend
